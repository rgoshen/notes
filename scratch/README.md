## Section 1 Getting Started

### What is testing?

- verify "if something works as intended"

Types of testing:

- Manual Testing
  - physically testing the code by hand (i.e. write some code, spin up the site and see if it works)
  - tedious & cumbersome
  - error prone
  - often incomplete (not all scenarios covered)
- Automated Testing
  - write some code to test the code you wrote for the feature/site you are working on
  - initial effort (write tests), no effort thereafter
  - predictable & consistent
  - high/complete code & scenario coverage can be achieved

### Unit Testing: What & Why?

What:

```mermaid
graph LR

    subgraph Unit
        b1[A building block of your application]
        b2[Ideally, the smallest possible building block]
        b3[e.g., a function, a class, a component]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph applicaiton
        unit1[Unit 1]
        unit2[Unit 2]
        unit3[Unit 3]
        unit4[Unit 4]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    b1[App = combination of all units]
    b2[if all units were tested, the overall app should work]
    b3[backed up by integration tests]
    b4[changes are always tested against all units to avoid bugs]
    b2 --> b3
```

Why:

- avoids endless amounts of manual testing
- allows you to cover (close to) 100% of your code & scenarios
- code changes are tested against all scenarios (almost) instantly
- write cleaner & better code (because testing then becomes easier)

### Unit, Integration & End-to-End (E2E) Testing

| Unit Testing                                          | Integration Testing                                           | End-to-End (E2E) Testing                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test the individual building blocks of an application | Test the combination of building blocks                       | Test entire flows and application features                     |
| Every building block (unit) is tested standalone      | Verify if building blocks (units) work together               | Test the actual "things" real users would do                   |
|                                                       |                                                               |                                                                |
| If all building blocks work, the overall app works    | Even if all units work standalone, the combination could fail | Real users use your app and its features, not individual units |

**You should combine all kinds of tests.**

| Unit Testing                                        | Integration Testing                               | End-to-End (E2E) Testing                           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Quickly spot and pinpoint breaking changes & errors | Test (parts of) processes & combinations of units | Test realistic user flows & behaviors              |
| Ignore actual user flows and interferences          | Spotting the exact root of an error can be tricky | Covering all possible behaviors can be challenging |

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

A framework/philosophy for writing tests

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    1[1. Write failing test first] --> 2[2. Implement the code ot make the test succeed] --> 3[3. Refactor] --> 1
```

## Section 2 Setup and Testing Software

[Slides](/slides/section-2-slides.pdf)

### Which Tools Are Needed for Testing?

- Application Setup & Code
  - Generally independent setup
  - All you need for manual testing
  - Testing setup can (and typically will) be integrated
    - e.g. based on Webpack, Vite, etc...
- Automated Tests
  - Test Runner
    - Runs your tests (i.e., the testing code)
    - Automatically detects testing code
    - Display results
    - e.g. Jest, Karma, Mocha, Jasmine, etc...
  - Assertion Library
    - Used to define expected outcomes
    - Checks whether expectations are met
    - Supports all kinds of expectations and modes (sync/async)
    - e.g. Jest, Chai, Expect, Sinon, etc...

## Section 3 Testing Basics

### AAA - Arrange, Act, Assert

|     |         |                                                                                 |
| --- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A   | Arrange | Define the testing environment & values                                         |
| A   | Act     | Run the actual code/function that should be tested                              |
| A   | Assert  | Evaluate the produced value/results and compare it to the expected value/result |
|     |         |                                                                                 |

Writing good tests is an interative process

## Section 4 Writing Good Tests

### What To Test & What Not To Test

- should only test your code
- don't test any third party code
- don't test what you can't change

### Only Test Your Code

**e.g. fetch() API**

- Don't test if it works as intended
- Don't test your server-side code implicitly via your client side code
  - Write separate tests for your backend code instead
- Do test your client-side reaction to different responses & errors

### Writing Good Tests

- AAA - Arrange - Act - Assert
- 1 - Only test one thing
- Focus on the **essence** of a test when arranging
- Keep your number of assertions ("expects") low

### Only Test One Thing

What is "one thing"?

- One feature
  - e.g. validate input or transform it

## Section 7 Mocking and Spies Dealing with Side Effects

### Spies & Mocks

**Spies**:

- "Wrappers" around functions or empty replacements for functions that allow you to track if & how a funciton was called

**Mocks**:

- A replacement for an API that may provide some test specific behavior instead
- Objects re-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive

**Dummy**:

- objects that are passed around, never actually used
- usually just used to fill parameter lists

**Fake**:

- objects that have working implementations but usually take some short cut which makes them not suitable for production
  - e.g. in memory database

**Stubs**:

- provide canned answers to calls made during tests
- usually not responding to anything outside what's programmed for the test
- may also record information about calls
  - e.g. email gateway stub that remembers the message it 'sent' or maybe only how many messages it 'sent'
