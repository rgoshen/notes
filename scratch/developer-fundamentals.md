## Introduction

### Goals

- Learn how to use the command line in your computer’s Terminal
- Learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control

There are fundamental tools that every developer needs to know outside of
programming languages: version control and using your Terminal’s command
line. Knowing these is as basic and necessary as learning to tie your shoes and dribble before you play a game of basketball. These tools can be a bit tricky at first, so was tying your shoes, but we’ll walk you through it. Soon these commands will be second nature.

The **command line** allows you to interact directly with your computer through typed commands. For instance, if you wanted to open up iTunes you could click on the icon, like you've been doing all your life. But if you wanted to open an application like a developer, you could type a specific statement into the command line and it would open. There’s so much you can do with your computer you don’t even realize yet.

If you’ve ever asked yourself how a team of developers collaboratively make changes to the same codebase, the answer is through **version control**. Git and the platform GitHub are the most widely used form of version control in the world. On GitHub, you can save the code you’ve been working on for your team to access, grab the changes they’ve made this week, and, if anyone breaks anything with an update, simply download an earlier version of your code that works.

You’ll be **pushing and pulling**, essentially saving and retrieving, code from GitHub through the command line.
