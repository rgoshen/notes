Other languages compile source code directly into machine code designed to run on a specific microprocessor architecture or OS (i.e. such as windows)

JVM mimics a Java processor that interprets the program into a sequence of actions or OS calls on any processor regardless of OS

Basics Steps in Java:

1. Developer writes program.java (source file)
1. Java compiles source file to program.class (byte code)
1. JVM executes the byte code on OS (interprets)
