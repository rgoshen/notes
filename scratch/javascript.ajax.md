- \*[AJAX]: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

## Introduction

In this subunit, you'll learn how to use **JavaScript to fetch and send data** to and from the web! To do this, you'll be leveraging a set of web technologies called **AJAX** or **Asynchronous JavaScript And XML**. It might be a heroic nickname, but it's not the most accurate term anymore. Things have changed a lot since AJAX first stepped on the scene. You'll start the subunit focusing on the AJ part of AJAX **- Asynchronous JavaScript**. You'll learn what asynchronous code is and how to manage it with the newer features of JavaScript. Then, you'll learn about async functions, and finally, learn how to use JavaScript to make HTTP requests with AJAX!

We'll introduce you to making AJAX requests using a popular JavaScript library - **Axios**. At the end of the subunit, there will be a hands-on exercise.

### Goals

- Describe what AJAX is
- Compare AJAX requests to non-AJAX requests
- Make GET and POST AJAX requests with axios
- Use async / await to manage asynchronous code with axios
- Describe what JSON is

## AJAX

### Traditional Requests

Traditional browser requests happen in response to:

- Entering a URL in the browser bar
- Clicking on a link
- Submitting a form

In all cases:

- Browser makes request
- Receives response
- Replaces entire resource with result

```html
<!-- EXAMPLE 1: SIMPLE GET REQUEST -->
<h2>Simple GET Request</h2>
<a href="/card" class="btn btn-primary">Get Card</a>

<!-- EXAMPLE 2: SIMPLE POST REQUEST -->
<h2>Simple POST Request</h2>
<form action="/borrow" method="POST">
  <input name="amount" placeholder="Amount" />
  <button class="btn btn-warning">Borrow</button>
</form>
```

### AJAX

AJAX web request:

- Made from JavaScript in browser
- JavaScript makes request (GET, POST, or other)
- You receive a response
- Do whatever you want with result!

AJAX is a technique in Javascript for sending requests and receiving responses from a server without having to reload the browser page.

> **NOTE: What Does AJAX stand for?**
>
> AJAX originally was an acronym for “Asynchronous Javascript and XML”.
> However many people don’t send XML over AJAX nowadays; it’s more common to send HTML or JSON.
> The technology is still the same, though, even if the data payload is commonly different.
> Ultimately, AJAX is a cooler sounding acronym than AJAJ or AJAH.

### Why Use AJAX

- Don’t need to reload entire page if just 1 thing is changing
- Interactive web sites
- Fewer full page loads from server
  - Your JS can talk to other servers directly
- Less info has to go across network

## AJAX with Axios

You don’t have to use [Axios](https://www.axios.com/) for this

- There is an old, clunky built-in tool: (XMLHttpRequest)
- Or a newer-but-still-clunky built-in tool: (fetch)
- Or lots of other libraries (including jQuery)

... but we’ll use axios for now! It’s featureful & popular

### Getting Axios

Can easily include it using a CDN link:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.js"></script>
```

### Making a Simple Request

```javascript
axios.get(url);
```

Make a GET request to that URL

### Not What We Expected

```javascript
let card = axios.get('/api/card');
console.log(card);
// "Promise {<pending>}"
```

### What’s A Promise

- We’ll talk about it in more detail when we get to Node.
- For now, all you need to know is that a promise is like a placeholder for a future value.
- We want to wait for the promise to have that value before proceeding.
- But we don’t know when the promise will receive its value!

## Handling Asynchronous Code

### Asynchronicity

AJAX requests are asynchronous

- The `axios.get()` completes before the response is received
- This means that if we want to use the data we get back from our AJAX requests, we need to wait until the response has been given to us
- We’re going to use two newer keywords in JS to do this: **async** and **await**!

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

### Await

Here’s what it looks like:

```javascript
await axios.get('/api/card');
// returns response object, with `.data` as response body
```

The code is asynchronous, but it “waits” for the AJAX request to complete.

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

### Async

Outside of all functions (like in the console), you can just use **await**.

To use in a function, you must mark that function as **async**:

```javascript
async function getCardInfo() {
  let response = await axios.get('/api/card');
  console.log('got', response);
  return response.data;
}
```

When calling asnyc function, you should await it:

```javascript
let card = await getCardInfo();
```

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

### Callbacks vs Async/Await

- Callbacks are what we’ve used for event handlers and timers
  - But they’re tricky to nest or do other complex things
- **async/await** makes it easier to handle chains of requests
  - Modern libraries like Axios return “promises”, which you await

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

## Axios API

### .get

```javascript
axios.get(url, [config]);
```

**config** is an optional object many Axios methods use

It holds specific configuration for what you need

_demo/templates/index.html_

```html
<h2>Simple GET Request</h2>
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="card-btn">Get Card</button>
<div id="card" class="box"></div>
<script src="/static/card.js"></script>
```

_demo/static/card.js_

```javascript
/* show ajax result directly in card box */

async function getCard() {
  let response = await axios.get('/api/card');

  console.log('getCard resp=', response);
  $('#card').html(response.data);
}

$('#card-btn').on('click', getCard);
```

To make request for /resource?a=1&b=2, can either use:

```javascript
axios.get('/resource?a=1&b=2');
```

or

```javascript
axios.get('/resource', { params: { a: 1, b: 2 } });
```

Second form is better: you don’t have to worry about how to “url safe quote” characters that aren’t normally legal in URLs.

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

### .post

Similar to `axios.get`, but uses a **POST** request

```javascript
axios.post(url, [data][config]);
axios.post(url, { a: 1, b: 2 });
```

This is passed as JSON to the server

_demo/templates/index.html_

```html
<h2>Simple POST Request</h2>
<input id="amount" placeholder="Amount" />
<button class="btn btn-warning" id="borrow-btn">Borrow</button>
<div id="borrowed" class="box"></div>
<script src="/static/borrow.js"></script>
```

_demo/static/borrow.js_

```javascript
/* show result of borrowing in box */

function showBorrow(res) {
  $('#borrowed').html(res);
}

async function borrowMoney() {
  let amount = Number($('#amount').val());

  let response = await axios.post('/api/borrow', { amount });

  console.log('borrow resp=', response);
  showBorrow(response.data);
}

$('#borrow-btn').on('click', borrowMoney);
```

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/back%20to%20top-%E2%86%A9-red)](#table-of-contents)

## JSON

- JSON is a string that looks like a JS object
- Most APIs use JSON to communicate
- By default, Axios recognizes JSON response & turns into JS object
- By default, Axios sends **POST** data as JSON

_demo/templates/index.html_

```html
<h2>Getting JSON Responses</h2>
<input id="ncards" value="5" /> Cards
<button class="btn btn-primary" id="hand-btn">Go!</button>
<div id="hand" class="box"></div>
<script src="/static/hand.js"></script>
```

_demo/static/hand.js_

```javascript
/* show result of hand in box */

function showHand(hand) {
  let $box = $('#hand');
  $box.empty();

  for (let { rank, suit } of hand) {
    let t = `<p>${rank} of ${suit}</p>`;
    $box.append($(t));
  }
}

async function getHand() {
  let ncards = Number($('#ncards').val());

  let response = await axios.get('/api/hand', { params: { ncards } });

  console.log('getHand resp=', response);
  showHand(response.data.hand);
}

$('#hand-btn').on('click', getHand);
```

> **NOTE: GLobal JSON Object**
>
> JavaScript comes with a global **JSON** object which can convert strings of JSON into JavaScript objects, and vice versa.
> These methods are J**SON.stringify** (object -> JSON) and **JSON.parse** (JSON -> object).

```javascript
JSON.stringify({
  name: 'Whiskey',
  favFood: 'popcorn',
  birthMonth: 7,
});
// '{"name": "Whiskey", "favFood": "popcorn", "birthMonth": 7}'
JSON.parse('{"name": "Whiskey", "favFood": "popcorn", "birthMonth": 7}');
// {name: "Whiskey", favFood: "popcorn", birthMonth: 7}
```

> **Note: “Form Encoded” POST requests**
>
> By default, Axios sends POST data as JSON.
> This is what almost all modern APIs expect.
> When web browsers submit POST forms in the traditional way (ie, not using AJAX), they don’t send this data in JSON — they send it in an older format, “form-encoded”.
> It’s not common that you’d want Axios to send POST data this way.
> But you may be working with older APIs that expect data in this format, or you may want to work on switching over an older, non-AJAX application to an AJAX one, and find it helpful for the server to receive traditional form-encoded data.
> For an example of how to do so, see [axios.browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#browser)

## Wrap Up

### Big Ideas

- Traditional web requests:
  - Made by browser (via link, form, URL bar, etc)
  - Replace entire page with thing linked to
- AJAX requests:
  - Made via JS AJAX calls
  - JS get data; JS decides what to do with it
- Axios is the popular AJAX client we’ll use
- AJAX calls are asynchronous & return a “promise”
  - You need to **await** those to get real results
  - Functions that use **await** must be **async**
- JSON
  - Axios parses JSON responses automatically for us
