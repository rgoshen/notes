## Introduction

In this unit, we’ll teach you some more advanced concepts in JavaScript - focusing on practical manipulations of the array data structure. You may struggle with these concepts when we introduce them to you, and that’s fine. Just remember, it’s like eating your vegetables - you may not love it at first, but they’re good for your growth, and you’ll eventually acquire a taste for them. Stick with it, and soon you'll be a wizard on the world wide web, just don't call yourself that when you're interviewing.

To succeed in this unit, make sure you do your homework exercises, code along to videos, and try everything we teach you on your own. We will build upon concepts covered in all the previous JavaScript units, and you will use what you learn here in all future units. In particular, you will use these skills in later units to refactor the code on some of your earlier projects - essentially rewriting the code more professionally and in a modern way.

### Goals

- Learn and get comfortable with advanced array methods
- Dive deeper into callback functions and higher order functions,introduced in [[developer-fundamentals.web-fundamentals]]
- Learn methods like **sum**, **find**, **index**, and **reduce**
