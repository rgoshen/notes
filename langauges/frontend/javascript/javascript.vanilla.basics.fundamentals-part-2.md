## Strings

Depending on what kind of work you’re doing, you might end up working more with pieces of text rather than numbers. A **string** is simply a piece of text… and is a fundamental building block of the language.

1. Read and code along with yet another [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings).
1. Got through this [lesson](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp) ton learn a bit more about what you can do with strings...be sure to take a peek at the [String Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp) page near the bottom, and do the exercises at the end!
1. Vocabulary time: a **method** is a bit of functionality that is built into the language or into specific data types. In the previous [W3Schools exercise](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp), you learned a few methods that can be sued on strings, such as <span style="color: red">indexOf</span> and <span style="color: red">search</span>. An exhaustive list of methods that can be used on strings can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).

### The Basics

#### Creating a string

```javascript
const string = 'The revolution will not be televised.';
console.log(string);
```

We are declaring a variable, initializing it with a string value, and then returning the value. When writing a string, you need to surround the value with quotes.
