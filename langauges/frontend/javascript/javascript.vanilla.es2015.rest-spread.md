## Introduction

In this subunit, we'll explore a handy operator... which is called either a **rest** or **spread** depending on how it is used. This operator can help tremendously with copying data structures, passing iterables to functions, and passing a variable amount of arguments or parameters. Since this ... operator is commonplace in modern codebases we'll take some time to teach you how to use it in-depth. The subunit will end with some exercises to make sure you'll be using it correctly in your day to day programming.

### Goals

- Understand what the rest operator does
- Understand what the spread operator does
- Use spread to copy arrays and objects
- Use rest to gather remaining arguments in an array

## What we used to do

- in JS, every function created using the **function** keyword has access to a special keyword called **arguments**

```javascript
function displayArguments() {
  console.log('The first argument is', arguments[0]);
  return `You passed in ${arguments.length} arguments!`;
}

displayArguments(1, 2); // "The first argument is 1"
displayArguments(); // "The first argument is undefined"
```

You cannot use **arguments** with arrow functions

### The Problem

- Unfortunately, **arguments** is not an actual array, it is an "array-like-object"
- It has a length property and can be accessed at a specific index, but does not have built in array methods like map, filter, etc.

```javascript
function doubleArgs() {
  return arguments.map(function (arg) {
    return arg * 2;
  });
}

doubleArgs(1, 2); // Uncaught TypeError: arguments.map is not a function
```

### So what did we do

- We turned the array-like-objects into an array, by making a copy of an array and setting the target of the copy to be the arguments array-like-object

```javascript
function doubleArgs() {
  let arrayFromArguments = [].slice.call(arguments);
  return arrayFromArguments.map(function (arg) {
    return arg * 2;
  });
}

doubleArgs(1, 2); // [2, 4]
```

Kind of gross...

## What are they

- They are both the "same" operator and use three dots...
- When the three dots are part of a function definition, we call the operator the "rest" operator
- The rest operator is the last parameter defined in a function and will evaluate to an array of all additional arguments passed in
- Let's look at that first!

```javascript
// we can call the value after the ... whatever we want

function displayArguments(...restOfArgs) {
  console.log('The first argument is', restOfArgs[0]);
  return `You passed in ${restOfArgs.length} arguments!`;
}

displayArguments(1, 2, 3); // "You passed in 3 arguments!"
```

This looks exactly like what we had before, but instead of an "array-like-object", we have an array.

We can now use methods like **map**, **filter**, etc. without having to make a copy of the array-like-object first

```javascript
function sumMany(...nums) {
  return nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

sumMany(5, 10); // 15
sumMany(10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10); // 90
sumMany(1); // 1
```

`...nums` collects additional arguments into single **nums** array.

## Collecting Remaining arguments

You can also specify several named parameter and collect teh rest.

```javascript
function onOrMoreArguments(first, ...more) {
  console.log(first);

  more.forEach((arg) => {
    console.log(arg);
  });
}
```

Here, **first** will be first item and **more** will be array of everything else.

## Spread Operator

`...` syntax, in a different context, is called the _spread operator_.

For example: when calling a function, you can "spread out" array elements:

```javascript
function takesFour(one, two, three, four) {
  console.log(one);
  console.log(two);
  console.log(three);
  console.log(four);
}

const names = ['Mary', 'Colt', 'Angela', 'Abe'];

takeFour(...names);

// Mary
// Colt
//Angela
// Abe
```

### Spread Operator for copies

You can use the same operator to copy over pieces of an array into a new array. This is a shorter version of using concat or writing your own loops

```javascript
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const newNums = [...nums, 4, 5, 6];
const newNumsFirst = [4, 5, 6, ...nums];
const newNumsInMiddle = [0, ...nums, 4];
```

### Spreading Objects

You can use the same operator to copy over pieces of an object into a new object.

```javascript
const whiskeyTheDog = {
  name: 'Whiskey',
  species: 'canine',
  cool: true,
};

// make a new dog but override the 'name' key

const gandalfTheDog = { ...whiskeyTheDog, name: 'Gandalf' };

console.log(gandalfTheDog);

/*
  {
    name: 'Gandalf',
    species: 'canine',
    cool: true
  }
*/
```

### Spreading Objects Warning

This is a newer feature of JavaScript, so it may not work in older browsers - specifically Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge

### Spreading and copies

- Using spread will only make a "shallow" copy.
- If there are nested objects, they will still contain the same reference
- For a deep copy, use libraries like lodash

```javascript
let odds = [1, 3, 5];
let evens = [2, 4, 6];

let collections = [odds, evens];

let copy = [...collection];

console.log(collection[0][0]); // 1

copy[0][0] = 'REPLACED!';

console.log(collection[0][0]); // "REPLACED"
```

### Where this is commonly used

For built in methods like `Math.max()` that do not accept an array

```javascript
Math.max([1, 2, 3]); //NaN
Math.max(...[1, 2, 3]); // 3
```

Spreading object and arrays in incredibly common in React and Redux and other modern front-end frameworks!
