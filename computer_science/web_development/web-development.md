## Introduction

You've been using the internet your entire life - chances are you've never really sat down and thought about the mechanics behind how it works. Well, it's not magic, but it's not rocket science either. The internet is built upon a foundation of agreed-upon protocols, the ones we'll be looking at handle data transmission. We'll go over some of the most important principles like HTTP, GET vs. POST, DNS, and the Request/Response Cycle.

This unit will explore how the internet works and the various protocols that enable browsers to send and receive data. We'll walk you through how searching for a URL returns a fully functional web page. This new knowledge is guaranteed to impress strangers at parties, but more importantly, most phone technical phone screens will quiz you on how stuff like the DNS works. Your ability to land an in-person interview will be directly tied to your ability to explain the concepts in this unit to a recruiter, concisely. You'll also learn about AJAX and how to write asynchronous code - which will enable you to write code that continues to execute while waiting to receive the response for a fetch request.

### Goals

- Gain a conceptual understanding of how the internet works,including learning about the protocols that power the web
- Learn how to access other peopleâ€™s publicly available data through APIs
- Learn how JavaScript can be used to request and receive data
- Learn about AJAX and how to write asynchronous code
