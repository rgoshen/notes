## Introduction

In the last subunit, you learned how to manage repositories locally. But what happens if your computer gets stolen or destroyed, or more likely, if you want to access our codebase from a new machine?

In this subunit, we'll introduce you to GitHub a cloud based code repository built around Git. Though there are other code repositories, GitHub is the most popular in the world and is the industry standard. Combined with effective use of Git you learned about in the last subunit, GitHub will allow you to master working effectively with a team.

### Goals

- Compare and contrast Git and GitHub
- List use cases for GitHub
- Get started with GitHub!

### What is GitHub

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service.

Simply put, it is a tool that enables collaboration by hosting shared Git repositories that teams of developers can all contribute to.

While GitHub uses Git, the functionality it provides is **VERY** different from Git so make sure you understand that Git and GitHub are not the same thing.

In short, Git is a Version Control System. GitHub is an online platform for hosting and sharing code, text files and even more complex file formats.

### Why use GitHub

It provides a great way for you to store your code in a remote location

It's a fantastic way to collaborate with other developers both privately and publicly

Many large open source projects are hosted on GitHub, which makes it very easy to examine the code both on GitHub and locally

In the next couple of chapters, we will learn how to move code from our local repository to a remote repository on GitHub using the **push** command

### Who uses GitHub

Here are some projects you may have heard of that are hosted there:

### Getting started with GitHub

If you don’t have an account with GitHub yet, head to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account

Be sure to use whatever email address is in your **.gitconfig**

If you’d rather sign up with a different email address, change your **.gitconfig** accordingly

You’ll run into some minor annoyances if there’s a mismatch between the email address in your GitHub profile and the email address in your **.gitconfig**

## Creating Remote Repositories on GitHub

- Navigate to [GitHub new](https://github.com/new)
- After naming and creating a new repository click **create repository**
- Follow the second block of instructions for pushing an existing repository from the command line

### What are we doing here

- Adding a **remote**
- Calling it “origin”

### What’s a remote

- It’s a nickname for a URL where your repository lives!
- Instead of typing/remembering the entire URL, we give it a nickname
- By default, this nickname is **‘origin’**
- `git remote add NAME_OF_REMOTE URL_FOR_REPOSITORY`
  - **NAME_OF_REMOTE**: origin
  - **[URL_FOR_REPOSITORY]**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO

### git remote add

This command tells our local repository about a remote repository located somewhere.

The location of our remote repository is **https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git**.

### git push origin

Now if we want to send our code to GitHub we could type in
`git push https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git master`
but typing that whole URL is quite a pain.

Instead, we give the URL a nickname (also called an alias) - “origin”

- Once the alias is set up we can simply type
- `git push origin master`
- This will send the code from our **master** branch to this remote repository.
- To see where your remotes are pointing to locally, type `git remote -v`.
- This will display both the alias and the remote url

If you need to remove a remote you can use `git remote rm NAME_OF_REMOTE`

## Pushing Your Code

The command we use is `git push NAME_OF_REMOTE NAME_OF_BRANCH`

### Setting the upstream

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

Now we can send our code from a local repository to our remote repository (which we aliased to **origin** in the previous command).

The `-u` flag allows us in the future to only have to type `git push` instead of `git push origin master`.

### Pushing code up to GitHub

Now when you type in `git push`, you will be prompted to enter your username and password for GitHub. While that is fine once or twice, it becomes quite a nuisance if you are pushing or pulling (retrieving code) frequently.

It would be nice if we could establish some trust between our computer and GitHub so that when we run `git push` or `git pull`, GitHub does not need to authenticate us. To do that we are going to create an SSH key.
