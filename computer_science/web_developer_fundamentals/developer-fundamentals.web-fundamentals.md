## Introduction

The **software engineering techniques** weâ€™ll teach you in this course build on **web fundamentals** like **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. We want to make sure you understand the basics of these languages before we get into more advanced techniques. Depending on your knowledge level, this unit could be mostly review. Every page on the internet uses some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - so once you learn how to use these languages effectively the possibilities are endless. Employers will want you to have knowledge of these languages - daily work will use these skills.

After that, we'll teach you about how to use **Chrome's Developer Tools** to debug your code. Debugging skills are arguably the most important part of being an engineer.

This unit will also look at a **JavaScript function called timers**. This is a function that allows you to call a second function after a set amount of time elapses. For instance, if you wanted to create a pop up to collect the emails of visitors to your web page, a timer would be an easy way to schedule that.

### Goals

- Review and expand on the web development fundamentals you'll need to succeed in any full-stack career
- Learn how to use Chrome's native debugger to find and fix problems in your code
- Learn about how timers work in JavaScript

## Web Fundamentals Refresher

### Web Review

In this subunit, we'll be reviewing the fundamentals of web development in order to give you a good base knowledge to build upon.

Every page on the internet uses HTML for its content, text, and images, CSS for visual styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements. Before we move further in this course it is important you know how to use these languages. They are present everywhere in our online life. Every type of aspiring programmer must understand how these languages work and interact.

#### Goals

### JavaScript Must Knows

#### Declaring variables

You do not have to know all the details of var, let, and const. However, you should be familiar with these concepts:

| Keyword | Can Reassign | Can Redeclare | Scope Rules |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| var     | yes          | yes           | function    |
| let     | yes          | no            | block       |
| const   | no           | no            | block       |

We will be using let and const primarily. You'll dive into the difference later in the course.

#### Conditional logic

- you should understand differences between:
  - `if`
  - `else if`
  - `else`

You should understand 'js expressions' are always converted to a boolean value when passed to a control statement

```javascript
if(<js expression>){

} else if(<js expression>){

} else {

}
```

You should be able to explain the difference between the following two snippets of code

```javascript
let n = 10;

if (n > 0) {
  console.log('n is valid');
} else if (n < 100) {
  console.log('n is valid');
} else {
  console.log('n is not valid');
}
```

```javascript
let n = 10;

if (n > 0) {
  console.log('n is valid');
}

if (n < 100) {
  console.log('n is valid');
} else {
  console.log('n is not valid');
}
```

#### Logical operators

- You should have an understanding of the logical operators:
  - || (OR)
  - && (AND)
  - ! (NOT)

#### Primitive data types

- You should be familiar with the following 5 primitive data types:
  - Numbers
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - Undefined
  - Null

#### Numbers

- You should be comfortable with:
  - converting a number to a string
  - generating a random number
  - Rounding a number the following functions:
    - Math.round()
    - Math.ceil()
    - Math.floor()

#### Strings

- You should be comfortable with:
  - Creating a string
  - Converting a string to a number
  - Iterating through each element in a string
  - Making a copy of a string

#### Booleans

- You should know the difference between a 'truthy' and 'falsy' value
- Know the following 6 'falsy' values in JavaScript
  - undefined`
  - 0
  - ""
  - false
  - null
  - NaN
- Know tow approaches for converting an expression to 'truthy' or 'falsy'
  - `Boolean(<expression>)`
  - `!!<expression>`

#### Iteration

- You should be very comfortable with the syntax for iterating through a string or an array using a 'for loop'

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

- You should understand the syntax for iterating through a string or an array using a 'while loop'

```javascript
let i = 0;

while (i < array.length) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

- You should understand the difference between a 'for...of' and 'for...in' loop

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

for (let n of arr) {
  // what will n be?
  console.log(n);
}
```

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

for (let n in arr) {
  // what will n be?
  console.log(n);
}
```

- You should be comfortable writing a nested for loop
- For example, how would you print each element in the following array of sub arrays?

```javascript
let matrix = [
  ['a', 'b', 'c'],
  ['d', 'e', 'f'],
  ['g', 'h', 'i'],
];

for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
  let subArr = matrix[i];
  for (let j = 0; j < subArr.length; j++) {
    console.log(subArr[j]);
  }
}
```

#### Arrays

- You should be comfortable with:
  - creating an array
  - getting and setting elements in an array
  - iterating through arrays
  - making copies of arrays

#### Objects

- You should be comfortable with:

  - creating objects
  - getting and setting key value pairs
  - iterating through objects
  - making copies of objects

- You should know the difference between dot and bracket notation
- You should understand the subtle differences between the following code samples:

```javascript
let arg = 'hi';
let obj = {};

obj.arg = 'there';

    =>{arg: 'there'}
```

```javascript
let arg = 'hi';
let obj = {};

obj[arg] = 'there';

    =>{hi: 'there'}
```

- dot notation uses literal arg string as key
- bracket notation allows you to pass arguments dynamically

#### Arrays and objects

- you should understand what the following code will do and why:

```javascript
// will this return true or false

[] === [];
```

- Here we are comparing if the array is the same actual array not the values held in the array
- The same result happens when comparing objects

#### Functions

- you should know the syntax for creating functions with and without parameters
- understand how to return values from a function
- how to invoke functions with and without arguments
- function scope vs global scope
- placing functions on objects (methods)
