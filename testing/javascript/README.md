## Introduction

Testing might not seem like the most entertaining thing in the world, but it will make your life so _much easier_. Do you want to make sure your programs work correctly, that they don’t break unexpectedly, and that they do what they are supposed to do?

Then you’re going to need to run all kinds of tests... and you’ll likely end up testing your coworker’s code too.

We’re not just teaching you how to write code in this course, we’re teaching you how to be the kind of software engineer a company will be proud to have on their team. This is only our first unit on testing, there will be many more to come.
